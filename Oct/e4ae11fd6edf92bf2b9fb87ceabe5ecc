Cape Town - Giant cellphone service providers have heeded calls to provide students with free internet access because of ongoing university disruptions.On Wednesday a statement issued by MTN South Africa confirmed this. The decision followed the UCT&#x2019;s request to three service provider companies on Monday.Students from UCT and the University of Pretoria will be able to access their online curriculum without incurring any data costs.UWC has also put an emergency plan in place. Face-to-face classes have been suspended and students will be given the choice to write exams December or early next year.Cape Peninsula University of Technology was set to hold its general assembly on Thursday, where the issue of exams is tabled on the agenda.MTN SA chief executive Mteto Nyathi said: &#x201C;As a responsible corporate citizen, MTN took the decision to provide free access to online educational content in order to complement existing classroom training, leverage the benefits of online training and assist the students and academic institutions to salvage the 2016 academic year.&#x201C;As MTN, we are mindful of the backlog that students and academic institutions are facing, and we believe that this gesture will help to maintain continuity and expedite access to much-needed educational content.&#x201D;Nyathi also appealed to other universities to tap into this initiative by providing the company with their URL addresses.Telkom, another service provider, reportedly confirmed that it was also giving students free internet access to university websites. It was reported that the free internet will be available until the end of the academic year.UCT spokesman Elijah Moholola said the initiative was set in motion so that students continued with their academic study online without having to endure any additional financial constraints.&#x201C;The current feasible way to complete the 2016 academic year is to provide learning materials online so that our students can access the necessary resources wherever they are.&#x201C;We are aware, however, that a number of students do not have the luxury of internet access off campus and would therefore have been unable to access these resources,&#x201D; said Moholola.The student protests have forced several universities to suspend classes, due to ongoing violence on university campuses.UCT said its students had the option to either write their final exams in December or in January.&#x201C;Exams will be held from November 7 to 25. Results are then expected on 23 December 2016.&#x201C;Deferred exams will be held from 9 to 20 January 2017.&#x201C;Students can choose between one of two options: either to write the full block of exams in November 2016 or to write the full block of deferred exams in January 2017. The time table for both blocks of exams will be released together so that students can make an informed choice,&#x201D; said Moholola.UCT said there were reports of protesters throwing stones at private security early on Wednesday, a fire was started in a parking lot and a window broken in the Falmouth building on the medical campus. A fight was also reported at Cissie Gool Plaza in the afternoon. The university&#x2019;s libraries were closed on Wednesday and on Thursday. The Jammie shuttle did not run on Wednesday, and has been suspended for on Thursday.UWC spokesman Luthando Tyhalibongo said petrol bombs were found on its main Bellville campus on Wednesday morning. Student leaders had not taken responsibility for the petrol bombs, and no arrests had been made, he said.A fire was started outside the university&#x2019;s Kovacs residence near the laundry section. He added that on Monday, the university&#x2019;s management held a meeting with the students, aimed at discussing and addressing their demands, which the students found to be unsatisfactory, leading to Wednesday&#x2019;s action.Among some of the students&#x2019; 40 demands are: scrapping of fees for replacement of student cards, clearing of students debts and no payment of registration fees, insourcing of workers, application form fees to be scrapped, to be able to graduate even with outstanding fees, students to be able to register for a full year and not a semester, basic services for residential services, and dropping of charges.In response, UWC said the list of demands could be classified into four categories.&#x201C;There are those demands that have financial implications for the university; the issues that require third party interventions, system issues, and the national issues that the university can resolve on its own.&#x201D;In the instance of fee replacement of student cards, the university said student cards would be free upon first registration and that providing a new card for each student annually would cost the institution R1 470 a year.It also added that the institution would be unable to write off students debts without the support from the government, and that an end to registration fees would amount to R24.2 million.At the University of the Witwatersrand, angry students chased vice-chancellor Adam Habib away from a peace accord meeting at a church in Braamfontein.
