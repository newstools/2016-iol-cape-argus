Cape Town - Certain things in life fit like a glove. Like bacon and egg, strawberries and cream and Masekind and Tannie Evita. Yes, readers, I had the honour of meeting this phenomenal person in real life.One evening I was at my desk being productive, when I was casually informed that Tannie Evita was in town and she would like to meet me. Honestly, I thought &#x201C;yeah right! You must be joking&#x201D;.A few days later I was given a number to call. Within seconds my meeting with Evita was scheduled and I was to attend the opening of her latest show: An Evening With Evita Bezuidenhout - and a visit backstage. The Artscape Theatre is the perfect setting for such an intimate show.The new show, in a nutshell, is: &#x201C;Still regarded as the most famous white woman in South Africa, Evita has taken over the kitchen in Luthuli House where as a member of the ANC she cooks for reconciliation, having put the cabinet on a strict diet. So join her in focusing on the news of the day with humour, confronting the realities of a rainbow nation in some trouble with optimism, and always keeping the glass half-full and not half-empty.&#x201D;The show was light, funny and amusing. We laughed so much Evita had to stop and wait for us to calm down. Backstage we took some pictures in her dressing room. It is a moment I will never forget.
