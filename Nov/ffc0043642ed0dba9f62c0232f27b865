Cape Town - Thousands of students are expected to march to and occupy Parliament on Thursday as President Jacob Zuma faces another vote of no confidence.The Congress of SA Students (Cosas) in the Western Cape said they had rallied students and pupils from across the province to join their march and occupation of Parliament.Cosas provincial chairman Michael Mayalo said they would support Zuma and wanted to see him being president until the end of his second term, in 2019.Following the release of the explosive &#x201C;State of Capture&#x201D; report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, which implicated Zuma, Eskom boss Brian Molefe, among others, the DA tabled a debate on motion of no confidence against Zuma set to take place on Thursday.Madonsela recommended that a judicial commission of inquiry into the influence of the wealthy Gupta family, who are said to be wielding too much power on Zuma, the cabinet and state enterprises, be established within 30 days after the release of her report.Mayalo said Cosas was &#x201C;highly disgusted by the childish call that has been made by the DA&#x201D; calling for the debate.&#xA0;Zuma on Wednesday returned to South Africa from a working visit to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he attended the African Union (AU) High Level Committee meeting to review and discuss the peace and security situation in Libya.He is expected to be in Parliament on Thursday.Cape Argus and ANA IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
