Cape Town - As violent protests on campuses continue, raising fears the academic year won&#x2019;t be completed, the UCT&#x2019;s SRC has called on vice-chancellor Max Price to suspend the 2016 academic programme for undergraduate students.The call came hours after an announcement by UCT&#x2019;s faculty of health sciences that teaching activities for its undergraduate programmes had been suspended and on a day thousands of students marched to the Union Buildings in Pretoria to hand over a memorandum of demands.UCT health sciences undergraduates were told they could go home immediately.The plan was to complete teaching and exams in a mini-semester in January.This would involve a brief period of continued teaching on 2016 academic work at the start of next year, followed by the final examinations that should have taken place next month.&#x201C;We therefore anticipate that the first teaching activities of the 2017 academic year will start later than usual,&#x201D; Professor Bongani Mayosi, dean of the faculty, wrote in an announcement to students.&quot;Classes for the first-, second- and third-year undergraduate programmes have been suspended for the rest of the year, but will resume in January 2017. This decision affects only the Faculty of Health Sciences. The academic programme for the rest of the Faculty of Health Sciences continues, as well as for the rest of the university&#x2019;s faculties,&quot; Mayosi said.In a statement on social media, the university&#x2019;s SRC said it had presented a series of proposals to Price, including that the academic programme for undergraduates be suspended and a mini semester take place next year to complete the curriculum and assessments.&#x201C;The current climate on our campuses has made it nearly impossible for most students to perform at the level required.&#x201C;The Blended Learning approach has resulted in large swathes of the curriculum and assessments being cut. Such a decision brings into question the integrity of the UCT degree.&#x201D;UCT spokeswoman Patricia Lucas said its executive had received the proposal from the SRC and it would be discussed.The university also confirmed two private security guards had been &#x201C;brutally attacked&#x201D; on upper campus on Wednesday.&#x201C;One was beaten up by a group of protesters near the food court. The other had a rock dropped on his head from an upper storey of the Steve Biko Student&#x2019;s Union building. It is reported that he is in hospital in a serious condition,&#x201D; it said in a statement.The incidents are under investigation.Meanwhile, the council of the University of the Western Cape has called for peace and stability on campus.&#x201C;In view of the current instability at UWC and at other higher education institutions, council supports the decision of the university&#x2019;s senate executive committee to use online platforms and other multiple modes of learning to assist students in finalising the academic year in preparation for the final examinations which can be written either in November 2016 or in January 2017.&#x201D; Cape Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
