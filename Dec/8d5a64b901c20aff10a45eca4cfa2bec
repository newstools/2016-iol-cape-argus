Three men were arrested and are due to appear in court. Police spokesman Captain FC Van Wyk said: The five houses are known drug dens in Manenberg. The houses identified are alleged to be used for drugs and firearm storage. Van Wyk said while no firearms were recovered during the raids the police still made breakthroughs. We have had several successes, including the arrest of three men in separate incidents such as malicious damage to property and dagga possession. We have confiscated an undisclosed sum of cash. He said money confiscated from the raids would be sent to the Asset Forfeiture Unit. In most cases the officers arrived at the homes while the occupants were still asleep and carried out rigorous searches.And while the officers believed the raids were successful, not all the residents of Manenberg agreed.Shahieda Abrahams, whose daughter s home was raided in Renoster Walk, said police entered the house without getting the permission of the homeowner. They must give a search warrant before they enter someone's house; they can t just go in, especially if the homeowner is not home. If it was my house I wouldn't have let them in at all, not without a warrant, she said. She said she saw no reason why police would raid her daughter's house. My daughter is not into illegal business. They must stop targeting innocent people and go out to get the gangsters. The police are scared of targeting gangsters. Another resident, Richard Adams, agreed that the police were heavy-handed. They must continue with the raids, but do their operations in a correct manner and not assault people. Van Wyk said the raids would continue across the province daily. Cape Argus
