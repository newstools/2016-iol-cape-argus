We suspended operations into town for about an hour, we transported the buses to the depot in Woodstock,&#x201D; she said.Operations only continued at about 5.15pm. Buses had to be escorted back to the CBD by law enforcement.Chamber of Commerce President Janine Myburgh said the short-term losses suffered from damage to property were a fairly small part of the problem.She said what concerned business most was that the ongoing protests created the image that things were not going well in the country and the government was unable to cope.&#x201C;This is damaging to business confidence and will discourage foreign investment.
