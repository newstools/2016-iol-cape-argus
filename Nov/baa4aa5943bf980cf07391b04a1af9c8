Johannesburg - Parliament s finance watchdog, the standing committee on public accounts, has sounded warning bells after a senior government official was attacked for blowing the whistle on corruption.Scopa chairperson Themba Godi said on Sunday that the committee had roped in the Hawks to investigate attempted murder charges against one of the officials in the Department of Defence and Military Veterans.The department told Scopa last week that its former chief financial officer had absconded from work and was subsequently fired.However, the official, whose name has been withheld by Scopa, contacted the committee to say he was in hiding after he was shot at for blowing the whistle on alleged tender fraud amounting to R170 million.The Hawks are investigating a number of cases Scopa referred to them relating to irregular expenditure amounting to billions of rand.Godi said he was shocked by the attack on the official, and wanted the Hawks to get to the bottom of the matter and arrest the culprits.He said the head of the Hawks, Lieutenant-General Berning Ntlemeza, would take up the case. We have never come across such a situation where a chief financial officer is threatened by corrupt people, said Godi. It shows how daring some people are. Those people should be charged and arrested, he said. This thing is a no-no. This isn't a Mafia state. This isn't Italy, he said. I've spoken to General Ntlemeza and this is a case we are forwarding to them under the new approach of cases we have submitted to them, he said.Scopa has taken a hard line against corrupt officials, and has invited the Hawks to its meetings when departments are submitting reports on irregular expenditure.Last week, Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu released his audit report into departments and entities, and found that irregular expenditure had shot up to R46 billion. That mainly involved officials deviating from normal tender processes in awarding contracts.In his report, Makwetu listed some of the entities and departments, including at provincial level, where supply chain management procedures were flouted.Godi said officials mustn't attempt to sweep corruption under the carpet.He said the Hawks had to deal swiftly with the former chief financial officer. The Hawks must investigate the death threats against the official and which tenders are linked to the threats, he added.Godi said the committee wouldn't allow a culture of fear against officials who blew the whistle on corruption and that corrupt people mustn't be allowed to hold the country hostage over their tenders.It was shocking that some people would be so daring and prepared to take extra steps to kill those who exposed their corrupt dealings, he said.The Star
