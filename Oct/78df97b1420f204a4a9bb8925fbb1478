Cape Town - Members of a private security company who caught an ATM robber in the act have slammed the police for failing to arrest the culprit.Ridwaan Mathews of Sniper Security Solutions says police officers refused to attend to the Crawford crime scene, and let the suspect go free without taking fingerprints.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andr&#xE9; Traut said the full account of Mathews&#x2019;s accusations had been forwarded to the Lansdowne police and an investigation would be instituted.Mathews said: &#x201C;The Sniper Security control room received a panic activation from the petrol service station Taronga Motors in Crawford.&#x201D;They dispatched a vehicle, and called the shop to find out more.&#x201C;The shop worker confirmed that a robbery was in progress and that they needed urgent assistance.&#x201D;The private security officers arrived at the scene, caught the ATM robbers in the act and were able to detain one of them, while two others ran away.&#x201C;The Sniper control room contacted the Lansdowne police and confirmed that they needed urgent assistance. We stressed that the suspects who had escaped were on foot, and that we wanted the police&apos;s assistance to search for them. An hour later and still no sign of the Lansdowne police,&#x201D; Mathews said.&#x201C;The police members were so uninterested and just said, &#x201C;sorry my friend this is not our area&#x201D;, yet they were smack bang at the crime scene,&#x201D; Mathews wrote.The private security officers wanted police to make the arrest and take the suspect, so that they could continue searching for the other two escaped suspects.When the police officers allegedly refused, Sniper Security officers took the detained suspect to Lansdowne Police Station. Later that evening, Mathews called the police for an update on the arrested suspect.&#x201C;We were totally dumbstruck when the police confirmed that they had released the suspect,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;What shocked us even further was that Lansdowne police did not take down the name and details of the suspect nor did they take the time to run a criminal background check on the suspect.&#x201D; Cape Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
