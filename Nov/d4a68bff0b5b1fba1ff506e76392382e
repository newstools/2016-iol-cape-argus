Cape Town - Months after losing his wallet, South African musician and talk show host Emo Adams had it returned to him by a good Samaritan who tracked him down and returned it.Adams was amazed by the selflessness of the man, known only as Randal.They met this week and the wallet was given back to him.Adams said he was delivering food parcels in Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain when he realised his wallet was missing. &#x201C;After a while I realised my wallet was not in my back pocket anymore and I knew I had not left it anywhere. I assumed I had been pickpocketed.&#x201D;He said he had got a call from a friend in Amsterdam, after he had received a call from someone who found the wallet.It turned out that it was Randal who called after he found the wallet in a field.&#x201C;I called Randal and met him outside the Philippi police station. I was on the fence about it, because I thought it was a random thing.&#x201D;Adams said he was very grateful to have his wallet back because he had just received his news ID card and licence and was not looking forward to going through the process of getting them again.&#x201C;I wanted to compensate him for his effort and he said no because he said he was doing the right thing. It was quite humbling and inspiring.&#x201D; [email&#160;protected] Cape Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
