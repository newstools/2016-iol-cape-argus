Cape Town - Weekend engagements between Cape Peninsula University of Technology&#x2019;s (CPUT) management and protesting students have resulted in a peace treaty which includes the university&#x2019;s exam timetable being postponed for another week.A statement released by the university on behalf of acting vice-chancellor Doctor John Volmink said exams have been postponed until Monday to allow student to choose their preferred exam timetable.Students, except for those studying Education and Health Sciences, have been given an option to write their exams this month or in January.Both examination sittings will have equal status and will have the normal supplementary examination option subject to the normal rules.&#x201C;I realise we have made some principled comprises in order to buy peace&#x2019; at our university. I want to apologise to you for the terrible impact this agreement may have on the extensive planning that has already gone into the scheduling of examinations, but I can only appeal to you to assist in whatever way you can to implement these decisions.&#x201C;Please understand that if there was any other way to bring about stability we would have done so,&#x201D; said Volmink.Some of the conditions to the peace agreement include the removal of private security on university campuses, no more disruptions, access to free wi-fi and a task team to assess readiness on campus examinations.On Sunday, the front entrance of the Cape Town campus was petrol bombed. CPUT&#x2019;s Lauren Kansley and police spokeswoman Brigadier Sally De Beer confirmed a fire incident that occurred at 6.10am.&#x201C;There was a fire at a mail room adjacent to Keizersgracht Street, CPUT Cape Town. Damage still to be determined and no one arrested,&#x201D; said De Beer.Meanwhile, security at the Cape Town International Airport and the V&amp;A Waterfront are on high alert following a statement released allegedly by #FeesMustFall movement that threatened to shut down service.The statement which went viral at the weekend read: &#x201C;We want to alert everyone in all universities that we are closing down the Cape Town International Airport and V&amp;A WaterFront. We will deal with all structural infrastructure until our call for Free Decolonial Education system is realised not in any coming year, but this year.&#x201D;Airport Company South Africa (ACSA) spokeswoman Deidre Davids said the emergency control centre had been activated. &#x201C;There is a heightened alert and we are in engaging closely with police.&#x201D;Carla White from the V&amp;A Waterfront said they were also aware of the arranged protest action on their property.&#x201C;Business will continue as normal, with our team monitoring the situation and offering full co-operation to police,&#x201D; said White.De Beer said police was aware of the protest plans and would deploy members where necessary.
