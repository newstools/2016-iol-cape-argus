Cape Town - Karoo politician Truman Prince has launched a scathing attack on DA leader Mmusi Maimane and his provincial counterpart Patricia de Lille for branding him a corrupt politician.The pair raised the ire of Prince during a &#x201C;back to the people&#x201D; tour, when they allegedly badmouthed Prince in front of community members.In retaliation Prince dubbed Maimane a &#x201C;born free kid&#x201D; with no struggle credentials and De Lille a &#x201C;Cape Flats spaza queen&#x201D; in response to claims she had allegedly told residents while visiting the area that he had run the town like a spaza shop.&#x201C;The DA&#x2019;s Born Free leader, Mmusi Maimane, lies to a small crowd in Beaufort West. It&#x2019;s the well-known rhetoric of the born free kid who made it, complete with well drilled knowledge of a bespoke political history, drafted by his pre-apartheid masters and without any practical experience by the abject absence of struggle credentials,&#x201D; Prince said.Prince said Maimane, who has never met him, had the audacity to call him a corrupt individual in front of the very people he had loyally served as town mayor.&#x201C;My track record shows that I am not corrupt. Maimane saying that I am, does not make it so. He speaks as he is told, by the very people who have also redrafted South Africa&#x2019;s struggle history to give the DA some standing among people who would otherwise never support the DA,&#x201D; he added.Prince said he is fed-up with DA leaders spreading lies about him and dragging his name through the mud.&#x201C;Maimane is desperately trying to be the glue that holds together conservatives, liberals, white capitalists, black struggle veterans, English and Afrikaans speakers in the DA. He wants to be all for all. And so he insults me. The ousting of Lindiwe Mazibuko, in tandem with the madam, Helen Zille, clearly shows that Mmusi is not the honourable political leader he is claimed by his masters to be,&#x201D; Prince added.Prince said given De Lille&#x2019;s should be careful to criticise. &#x201C;Overseas trips; wine estate breakaways; careful Pat,&#x201D; he warned.Asked for comment the DA&#x2019;s Anneke Scheepers said the party was committed to bringing change to Beaufort West and has put an end corruption once and for all. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s quite apparent these are the desperate ramblings of a disgraced and discredited ANC leader,&#x201D; she added.
