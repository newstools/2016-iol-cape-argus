This after two videos of bullying, taken at the school in less than a week, have gone viral. The education department is investigating.MEC for education Debbie Sch&auml;fer s spokeswoman, Jessica Shelver, said it was made aware of the second video on Tuesday and the district director and school circuit manager called an urgent meeting with the high school s management. The school acknowledged that they have challenges and that running a punitive process as they have been, isn t working. It is evident the school needs to plan for medium and long-term interventions to address bullying. This needs to be done in a holistic manner. In the latest video a girl is seen assaulting another while other pupils looks on and take videos. One male pupil tried to intervene and stop the attack.Shelver said the victim was receiving counselling and the department was taking steps to address bullying in schools.The steps include; life orientation teachers focusing on equipping pupils with knowledge and skills to deal with conflict in a healthy manner, teachers being sent on workshops guiding them to deal with protecting pupils and anti-bullying workshops with peer leaders and parents. It is crucial that the rights of learners are respected and protected and that learning environments are created where learners can, free from abuse, make full use of their learning opportunities. The department will work with the district and all roleplayers to ensure that the challenges at the school are addressed. Shelver said its Safe Schools hotline was available to all pupils, parents and teachers who need to report crime and abuse on 0800 45 46 47.The mother of the girl assaulted, said the incident had been a difficult for her daughter, who has refused to return to school. Children and parents must work together. I am so glad parents and law enforcement have stood by me. Cape Argus
