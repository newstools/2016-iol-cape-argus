Cape Town - As the city centre moves towards becoming a 24/7 work, play, live and stay destination, keeping everyone safe is proving an increasing challenge for the Central City Improvement District (CCID).The CCID spends at least 43 percent of its annual budget - R22.4 million - on safety and security measures in the 1.62km area under its jurisdiction.Over the past year, the CCID has formed various partnerships including with the Long Street Association to keep people in the city safe, especially with the rapidly growing night time economy.The CBD generates 25 percent of the metropole&#x2019;s economy and employs 30 percent of its workforce.New hotels and apartment buildings are also rapidly rising in the CBD with a value estimate of R8 billion a few months ago, being revised to closer to R11bn.&#x201C;The demand on resources - both our own and those of our partners - increases from season to season, and it becomes increasingly important to find collaborative paths to follow,&#x201D; said the CCID&#x2019;s chief executive Tasso Evangelinos at the annual general meeting on Monday night.According to the CCID&#x2019;s annual report, 1 196 arrests were made in the CBD, 39 524 warnings issued and 110 108 crime-prevention initiatives conducted over the past year.The CCID also assisted at the scene of 745 motor-vehicle incidents, 553 medical and rescue callouts and rendered assistance to the public 883 times.Evangelinos said the CCID was looking to bolster safety in the city&#x2019;s main party district - Long Street - in the future following the successful deployment of 10 additional law enforcement officers to patrol the area from Wednesday to Saturday between December 1 last year and April.&#x201C;The additional deployment made a huge difference,&#x201D; said Evangelinos.All the CCID&#x2019;s 81 foot patrol now wear body video units linked to CCTV with infrared video and audio recording capabilities.Evangelinos said this made public safety officers more accountable for the way they treated those they encountered in the execution of their duties.&#x201C;They are the most effective in behaviour modification and we have certainly had a great deal of success with them in the CBD as we have seen public behaviour change for the better,&#x201D; said Evangelinos.Evangelinos said the CCID&#x2019;s safety and security department had over the past year attended many incidents involving retail venues after hours, including damaged shop windows and doors left open unintentionally.The CCID had also dealt with 262 illegal trading offences.The almost 13 000 parking-related fines issued had yielded income of over R8m for the city.
