Cape Town - The family of Athlone businessman, Naushad Deshmukh Khan known only as Naushad Khan by friends and associates, are growing increasingly desperate to find him.Six armed men allegedly kidnapped him while he was locking-up his clothing store in Hadji Ebrahim Crescent.Khan, 46, was with a 51 year-old woman when he was accosted by his alleged kidnappers who forced him into the back of a Toyota LDV before speeding off.There has been no word yet on the developments on the case, said a family spokesperson who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police are following up on the case. All we can do is wait, she said.Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut said there were no further developments.Chairwoman of the Athlone Community Policing Forum Aziza Kannemeyer, said: We understand the sensitivity around the issue and the trauma they may be experiencing as the family. But I think everyone is hopeful the matter will be resolved and the individual returned to his family. She said the incident has caused fear in the community. Athlone has not experienced hijackings and kidnappings this much before. People are becoming more afraid and the attitude towards crime is zero tolerance. This has a tendency to spiral out of control when the community takes justice into their own hands and the wrong people are caught, Kannemeyer said. gadeeja.abbas@inl.co.zaCape Argus
