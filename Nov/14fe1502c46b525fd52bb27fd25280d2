Parliament - Restored head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) Robert McBride says systemic corruption in the SAPS will be his top priority now that he&#x2019;s back in the saddle.Last week, the National Prosecuting Authority dropped the charges against McBride relating to his alleged altering of an Ipid report on the rendition of several Zimbabweans - supposedly in order to protect former Hawks head Anwa Dramat and his Gauteng counterpart, Shadrack Sibiya.On Wednesday, McBride made his first appearance before Parliament&#x2019;s police oversight committee since his suspension more than a year ago by Police Minister Nathi Nhleko, after the Constitutional Court set aside his suspension and Parliament declined the minister&#x2019;s request to subject McBride to a misconduct inquiry.McBride said after the meeting he had always been adamant there was no case for him to answer to and that the dropping of the charges vindicated this view.&#x201C;The issue is, did our democracy work? Where there have been failures in one arm of governance, another arm will assist,&#x201D; McBride said.&#x201C;In our case, it was the courts, so the democracy works, and that&#x2019;s why the different elements of democracy are in place, to ensure the checks and balances are kept and there isn&#x2019;t abuse of power.&#x201D;His most pressing concern now was Ipid&#x2019;s ability to take on complex systemic corruption problems.&#x201C;Because if we are able to deal with systemic corruption within the SAPS, it sends a message, as most systemic corruption is carried out by senior members, and if we&#x2019;re able to effectively deal with that and eventually get prosecutions, it will send a message to the lower ranks.&#x201C;And you&#x2019;ll have a trickle- down effect of an improvement in ethics and integrity,&#x201D; McBride pointed out.But he wouldn&#x2019;t be drawn on specific investigations, saying only that there was &#x201C;no glass ceiling or otherwise&#x201D; on how far up his investigations could go.&#x201C;I must go without fear, favour or prejudice to wherever the investigation takes me,&#x201D; McBride said.Political Bureau IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
