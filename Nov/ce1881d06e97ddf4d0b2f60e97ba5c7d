Cape Town - Cape Town&#x2019;s premier shopping and leisure centre, the V&amp;A Waterfront, is not immune to falling foul of the city council&#x2019;s building regulations.It is being fined R71 728 for starting construction on a temporary, demountable parking garage without approval.The structure, a Dutch steel and concrete design to accommodate 570 parking bays, is a first for Cape Town.Two levels have already been constructed on 2 411m2 of what was previously an open parking area next to the Lookout in Granger Bay.The V&amp;A Waterfront submitted its precinct and site development plans for the site in mid-September, but did not wait for the city to give the thumbs up before it started erecting the structure.The city ordered construction to stop at the end of that month, but the Municipal Planning Tribunal found that despite claims that this had happened, minor work was still continuing on site.Building plans were only submitted last month.In determining the gravity of the unauthorised construction the city&#x2019;s planning department said in a report to the tribunal: &#x201C;Although the contravention was constructed recently and the structure is temporary... the gravity is not serious.&#x201C;The impact however is significant in that the parking garage is a highly visible structure at the entrance to V&amp;A Waterfront.&#x201D;In deciding on the penalty, the city said the V&amp;A Waterfront had also previously contravened the Municipal Planning by-law. Chief executive of the V&amp;A Waterfront, David Green, has conceded that the company was at fault.&#x201C;We got ahead of ourselves. They were correct to say stop, you haven&#x2019;t got that final consent&#x2019;. It was a good governance process. A fair decision was made.&#x201C;It was government working well. There was a good healthy debate with some saying it&#x2019;s a big company. Make an example, punish them&#x2019;.&#x201D;Green said the company was desperate to expand its parking availability before the peak holiday season, and the HSBC Rugby Sevens in early December.The new parking garage would become the closest Waterfront parking to the Cape Town Stadium.&#x201C;We did have the correct zoning and a precinct plan... it just got caught up in process,&#x201D; he said.The Municipal Planning Tribunal has recommended a fine of one percent of the value of the work completed by September 30 which amounted to R7.1 million, according to a quantity surveyor&#x2019;s report.City officials had initially recommended a much higher penalty of R846 261 in terms of the city&#x2019;s standard operating procedure for dealing with administrative penalties.Green said the demountable structure would probably remain on site for at least five years when development at the V&amp;A Waterfront is expected to shift to the Granger Bay area.
