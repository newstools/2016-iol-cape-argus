Cape Town - Rocklands in Mitchells Plain is on a knife-edge after at least seven people were killed or wounded in shootings during the week.On Thursday night a 23-year-old man was gunned down and two others were injured in Kittyhawk Street in Rocklands.It is alleged that the deceased was a member of the School Boys Gang and the two injured men were bystanders, aged 26 and 32, who were caught in the crossfire.Police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk confirmed the incident and said it had occurred at 7:58pm.&#x201C;According to reports, the victims were standing together when unidentified suspects opened fire on them. A murder and attempted murder case was opened for investigation,&#x201D; he said.In a separate incident, which could not be linked to the apparent gang violence, a woman&#x2019;s body was found lying in an open field between Metropolitan and Bentley Streets in Beacon Valley near Rocklands.Van Wyk said the body was found at around 11:35am after police had received an anonymous complaint.Community Police Forum (CPF) chairman Abie Isaacs said the situation in the Rocklands area was &#x201C;volatile&#x201D;.He said: &#x201C;We have had a number of incidents over this week, since last weekend.&#x201C;Police are trying their level best to to deal with the current situation holistically, but need the assistance of community members to come forth with information.&#x201D;Isaacs attributed the flare-ups to swift police action that is upsetting the balance of power in the gangs.Last week police confiscated several illegal firearms in the area.&#x201C;Since the guns were confiscated, we have seen a spike in shooting incidents. We suspect it&#x2019;s a turf war between groups,&#x201D; said Isaacs.On Wednesday, a 32-year-old man was gunned down in Heinkel Street. Van Wyk said that, on arrival at around 8:30pm, police found the body lying on the ground riddled with bullet wounds.&#x201C;The victim died on the scene due to injuries sustained.&#x201C;It is alleged that an Opel Corsa LDV pulled up near the victim and shot several times towards him, which fatally wounded him,&#x201D; said Van Wyk, adding that a murder case had been opened.And earlier in the week, two unidentified men in their 20s were killed after they were shot in Spreeu Crescent in Rocklands just before 9pm on Sunday.A third casualty, a woman, sustained gunshot wounds to her legs.Van Wyk said a double murder and an attempted murder case had been registered for further investigation.Lamenting the dearth of assistance from the community in fighting crime, Isaacs said: &#x201C;We have two types of communities; the first one is the one that protects the bad elements, and the second would be the one that comes forward with information to help secure arrests.&#x201D; [email&#160;protected] Cape Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
