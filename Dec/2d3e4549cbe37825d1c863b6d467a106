Cape Town - While most people are content with decorating trees in the festive season, others like to spread the Christmas cheer beyond their homes.Gerry Smeda, from Kuils River, has taken his decorations to the next level, adorning the outside of his home with a life-sized helicopter fashioned out of lights, flanked by two vintage VW Beetles. But it s not just for the show: Smeda, 60, uses his electric light show to raise funds for charity, and has done so for the last 11 years. It feels more than great to have done this, it s all just great fundraising effort. I have always had an interest in Christmas decorations from a young age, hence the theme of having festive lights around the house, which has attracted a lot of people. Visitors come from as far as overseas to see his display, bringing along donations of money and toys. Last year, Smeda and his family raised R14000 through a tin collection, which they donated to the Douglas Murray Old Age Home in Retreat. We raised R84000 which we contributed towards the Tygerberg Children s Hospital, and this year we also plan to contribute whatever we have managed to raise to the hospital s ICU for newborns. The Smedas also plan on collecting and donating 600 toys to the kids at Tygerberg Hospital by December 24.Cape Argus
