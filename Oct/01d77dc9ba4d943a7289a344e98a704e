Cape Town - City council Speaker Dirk Smit has said he will investigate the conduct of a ward councillor who is accused of assaulting a Fish Hoek resident and allegedly breaking his arm.The councillor, whose identity is being withheld until his first appearance in court on October 31, is also the subject of a police probe.Police arrested the 56-year-old councillor last Wednesday, but he was released shortly after receiving a notice to appear in court next week.Michael Kerr, 57, from Fish Hoek said he and his wife tried to reverse out of a driveway on Fish Hoek main road when he noticed a car blocking his exit.&#x201C;I went inside the shop and no one knew who the driver was. I waited outside of my car for a while and noticed that the car blocking mine had a councillor&#x2019;s disc.&#x201C;The next building was the provincial southern offices and I asked the security whose car it was.&#x201C;Eventually, the councillor came down and apologised, saying he did not know that he parked in a driveway.&#x201C;I asked him to move his car and he told me to wait. I told him I was in a hurry. He pointed a finger in my face and told me I had no choice but to wait,&#x201D; said Kerr.As the two left the provincial offices, Kerr said he accidentally bumped into the councillor, who viewed it as an attack.An argument ensued which soon became physical: &#x201C;I was standing looking for my car keys to flatten his tyre when out of the corner of my eye I saw him come towards me in a tackle.&#x201C;He kicked me and the force of it shattered the bone of my arm. I stood up and tackled him on the pavement.&#x201C;He tried to kick me in the private parts. The fight ended up in the street.&#x201C;My car keys fell out of my hand and that was when I noticed that my arm was broken,&#x201D; he said.The &#x201C;excruciating pain&#x201D; convinced Kerr to lay a charge of common assault when he was told his arm was broken.Police spokeswoman Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of common assault was being probed and that the councillor would appear in court next week.Smit said he was not aware of the incident or police probe, but conceded it was a serious matter in need of investigation.&#x201C;This is the first I have heard of this. It is a serious matter but I cannot comment further. On Monday when I get to my office, I will get the facts and investigate this,&#x201D; he said.Kerr approached the ANC Parliamentary Constituency Office for assistance after he feared his case would be &#x201C;swept under the carpet&#x201D;.The ANC has claimed the councillor &#x201C;pulled some strings&#x201D; not to be held in custody until his first court appearance, which they say should have happened in 48 hours and not next week.
