Cape Town - An online petition appealing to mayor Patricia de Lille not to remove mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith from his job has set the cat among the pigeons.Created on Monday and also sent to dozens of councillors and city officials via email, the petition asks De Lille to reconsider Smith&#x2019;s role in stamping out crime, saying he has shown his commitment and dedication to partnering with communities to help them protect themselves against crime, gangsterism and drugs.The petition aims to get 1 000 signatures and, by the time of going to print on Thursday, had not yet reached half that number.Last month, reports swirled within DA circles that De Lille was planning on removing Smith from his job as part of an imminent mayco reshuffle.She denied the claims and said her new Mayco, which would take up their new portfolios in January, had not yet been finalised.The petition&#x2019;s creator, an office worker from Brackenfell who only wants to be known as Adele, said the petition had not been created with any malicious intent or political agenda.When contacted by the Cape Argus she said she wanted people to show their support for Smith because she believed he was committed to his job. &#x201C;He gets his hands dirty, he gets things done, he&#x2019;s a straight-shooting, hard-working person who&#x2019;s willing to help the community.&#x201D;The petition praises Smith for his hands-on approach to crime fighting and his support of volunteers in communities affected by crime.&#x201C;Alderman Smith has a very unique understanding of the challenges faced by the majority of neighbourhood watches. He invests a significant part of his personal time working with community crime fighting structures and experiences the specific challenges of the various communities at ground level,&#x201D; it reads.Adele said it was to be expected that some would not want to support the cause, but she believed Smith&#x2019;s efforts had to be recognised.&#x201C;He&#x2019;s got a passion you can&#x2019;t buy anywhere and he has shown he cares,&#x201D; she said.But not everyone agrees.Former city executive director Gerhard Ras, a close confidante of De Lille for years, as a one-time chief executive for the Independent Democrats, responded to the petition on email by writing: &#x201C;I certainly do not support this. The appointment of a Mayco member is the statutory prerogative of the mayor. JP Smith is playing silly games as usual by orchestrating revolt against the mayor. He is using you to pursue his undermining modus operandi as he usually does.&#x201C;He is a law unto himself and throws tantrums when he does not get his way. #JPSmithMustgo#.&#x201D;Ras left the employ of the city at the end of August after council approved a R3.5 million golden handshake to terminate his contract prematurely.ANC councillor Khaya Yozi responded: &#x201C;Dear all, Cllr JP Smith MUST GO!!! Thank you Mayor Patricia De Lille.&#x201D;Smith on Thursday distanced himself from the petition, saying he did not know the creator. The petition had the potential to create more antagonism against him and to aggravate an already tenuous situation, he said.&#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t spoken to anyone or initiated or driven anything. I haven&#x2019;t asked for it. This is a spontaneous response from the public. It&#x2019;s just provoking the situation and making it worse.&#x201D; [email&#160;protected] Cape Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
