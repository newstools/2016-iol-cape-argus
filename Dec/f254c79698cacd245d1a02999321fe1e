Cape Town - Hot on the heels of a beach access row in Saldanha Bay, residents in the small town of Strandfontein on the West Coast are up in arms about a curfew put in place at their beach.The Matzikama town is home to a few hundred residents but is a popular holiday destination. The DA-led municipality of Vredenburg has reportedly instituted a curfew, preventing people from accessing the beach after 7pm.It s also believed that residents have been issued with access cards, similar to those issued to residents of Saldanha Bay. Vredenburg local Andre Lewaks, 39, said it was a horrible tactic, especially for previously disadvantaged people .However, acting municipal manager Gerald Seas denied this was the case. I am not aware of any curfew in place, he said. Lewaks, who is also a well-known social activist, said he learnt about the restrictions via messages on Facebook. You have to have a special pass to access residents over there actually have a residence pass to access these areas, Lewaks said. He said the practice reminded him of the pass laws under the apartheid government. I think it s a terrible thing that s happening I mean they (leaders) are supposed to unite people, especially now that it s the festive season. But Seas said: People can still go on to the beach. However, vehicles are just allowed on certain parts of the beach. He said it was not accurate that residents were given access cards. ANC spokesperson in the West Coast Region Sammy Claassen said the move by the Vredenburg municipality was unacceptable . Cape Argus
