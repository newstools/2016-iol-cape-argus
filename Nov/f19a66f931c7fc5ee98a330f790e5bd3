Cape Town - Five suspects have been arrested after being found with more than 500 000 Mandrax tablets.The suspects, aged 20, 39, 40, 43 and 54, were arrested in Harare, Khayelitsha on Sunday night.Community leaders say drugs are a massive problem in the area.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said the bust was a result of the police&#x2019;s &#x201C;endeavours to root out the evil phenomena of drugs in the province&#x201D;.He said the bust had been made when police conducted an operation at an informal dwelling.&#x201C;They discovered an underground storage facility for the Mandrax under the dwelling. They seized drugs with an estimated street value of R26.4 million. It is regarded as a significant blow to the drug trade, which will now be further investigated.&#x201D;Traut said the suspects will appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate&#x2019;s Court once they have been charged.&#x201C;The Western Cape police management commended the members for their sterling work and encouraged them to continue to fight crime with vigor.&#x201D;Khayelitsha Development Forum chairman Ndithini Tyhido congratulated the police on their bust, saying drugs are a big problem in the area. &#x201C;Drugs on their own have a huge impact on development here in Khayelitsha. There are a lot of negatives that drugs have on the community.&#x201C;We encourage members of the community to come forward and report drug dealers.&#x201D;He said that because drugs were a business that involved people, there should be residents who know who the dealers are.&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know of any labs that produce drugs in Khayelitsha, so our suspicion is that the drugs come from outside Khayelitsha.&#x201D;He said Mandrax tablets have been popular in Khayelitsha for years and busts like these help with reducing crime in the area. &#x201C;We have a strong belief that drugs play a role in that kind of behaviour. This bust makes a dent in dealing with the actual murder rate in area.&#x201D;Community Police Forum (CPF) chairwoman Nomawethu Mosana agreed with what Tyhido said and added that drug use starts from an early age. &#x201C;The drugs do affect the crime levels here. They always commit crimes when they are high. They never sleep, they are always wreaking havoc.&#x201D;She said the forum tried to curb youngsters from taking drugs through awareness campaigns at schools and in the community and by being visible on the streets. &#x201C;That does help to curb it a little.&#x201D;She said it was a frustrating fight because those who were caught were usually released within days.
