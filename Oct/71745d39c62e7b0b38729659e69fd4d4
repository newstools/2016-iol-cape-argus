Cape Town - Matric pupils caught cheating in their final exams could face serious consequences, including having their results declared null and void.With only a few days left before the start of the exams, Education MEC Debbie Schafer has cautioned matric pupils they could be disqualified from the exams if caught cribbing or for other forms of cheating.She visited ID Mkize Secondary in Gugulethu yesterday where matric pupils signed a pledge committing to comply with the exams&apos; rules and regulations.Schafer said the results of candidates found with crib notes or carrying any electronic devices could be declared null and void.&#x201C;When the candidate&#x2019;s results are declared null and void, the result for the specific subject is marked as irregular but the candidate will receive results for the other subjects as well as a letter informing the candidate about the irregularity that occurred and the sanction imposed.&#x201C;The candidate would not receive a National Senior Certificate until she/he rewrites the subject and applies for a combination of results.&#x201D;Disqualified pupils could be banned from writing the exams for between one and three years.&#x201C;This will have obvious effects on the candidate&#x2019;s future study plans and opportunities. Learners have spent at least 12 years at school and should not risk throwing all this away by choosing to use irregular means to pass the examinations.&#x201D;She said the Western Cape Education Department had employed 1 701 invigilators at the 452 exam centres. Their duties would include checking whether candidates were adhering to the NSC rules and regulations.Last year, 16 Western Cape candidates were &#x201C;disqualified&#x201D; because of irregularities and had their results declared null and void.
