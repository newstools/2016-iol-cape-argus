Cape Town - More than 11 100 students and supporters have signed an online petition calling on Rhodes University to postpone exams and protect students.The petition was started by the #FeesMustFall movement at the university, saying the institution had become a hostile place in recent weeks.&#x201C;The brutal and pervasive police action meted out to students has destroyed the university as a place of learning. Despite the fact students no longer feel safe on campus, the university has set up rigid rules for exams.&#x201D;They said the new arrangements set by the institution left students without a viable option. The university gave students two options: write exams as scheduled, or write them next year with an order to vacate residences within 48 hours. The movement said the options they were given were unrealistic, particularly for those &#x201C;who cannot afford to leave at such short notice as it is not practically and financially viable&#x201D;.&#x201C;As it currently stands, the university is not giving students a fair choice.&#x201C;Instead, they are pressurising students to write under volatile conditions; in the sense that if they write in November they are guaranteed supplementary examinations.&#x201D;They ask that all exams be postponed to January.SRC president Gift Sandi said most students wanted to write exams and complete the academic year.&#x201C;People want to write, rather than delaying the year. Things have died down and even those that are saying we must not write on social media, are going to write their exams.&#x201D;The petition started off with a goal of 5 000 signatures. By 5pm on Monday, 11 182 people had signed. Despite calls for the exams to be postponed, the university started with practical and theoretical exams last week.They have hired private security to maintain order and there had been no reports of disturbances.
