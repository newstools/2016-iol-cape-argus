Cape Town - Mediation, ordered by the State, in a case involving a brawl following a city councillor parking in a residential driveway, has failed.DA councillor Simon Liell-Cock appeared in the Simon s Town Magistrate s Court on Wednesday on a charge of common assault following an altercation over parking which led to Michael Kerr, 57, of Fish Hoek having his arm broken.Liell-Cock s lawyer Madelein Wohler said they had attempted mediation and had met with Kerr and the prosecution.She said Kerr had been unwilling to attempt mediation and had become upset and aggressive when they met at the Simon s Town court.Wohler said Liell-Cock, the councillor for Ward 61, had brought counter charges of assault and defamation against Kerr following the alleged brawl. I have advised my client that there is no basis for the charges brought against him and am confident the matter will be withdrawn. Kerr was not in court on Wednesday, but claimed at the time that Liell-Cock had parked in his drivewayon October 19 and when he asked him to move his vehicle, he had refused.Kerr then allegedly threatened to let Liell-Cock s tyres down and the two allegedly got into a brief brawl during which Kerr s right arm was broken.On Wednesday, Liell-Cock appeared before magistrate Carmen Wyngaard, who postponed the matter until December 9.[email&#160;protected]Cape Argus
