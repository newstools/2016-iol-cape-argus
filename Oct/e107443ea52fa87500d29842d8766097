Cape Town - The City of Cape Town has expanded its CCTV footprint in Athlone, to the delight of neighbourhood watches and community policing forum in the area.The Athlone area had a boost to its existing 17 CCTV cameras located throughout the area, with the latest addition of five cameras in Silverton and Bridgetown.The location of the high speed dome cameras was carried out in conjunction with the police, with the aim ofidentifying suspects to assist police investigators.The project was funded by the Integrated City Development Grant, with the city hoping more will be funded in this financial year to Bridgetown and Kewtown, stretching the camera network as far as Jan Smuts Drive.Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said they demonstrated to the community how the cameras worked. They were impressed by what the cameras were capable of capturing.Smith said the community andneighbourhood watches were the eyes and ears on the ground.&#x201C;The cameras are a huge game changer for us and we have invested a lot in them. The crime stats are a reflection of those improvements.&#x201D;Athlone CPF chairwoman Aziza Kannemeyer said they hoped more cameras would be installed in residential areas.&#x201C;Our concern was they are more in the business area and the (council) was not taking into account the residential areas. The council should start looking at the needs of the community as well.&#x201C;It is all good and well to protect businesses, but what about residents who are affected by crime on a daily basis.&#x201C;Once those businesses shut down the crime continues in residential areas. Shootings in Kewtown are on the rise again.&#x201D;She said Athlone had become a hotspot for robberies that usually occurred in the morning when people were on their way to school and work.
