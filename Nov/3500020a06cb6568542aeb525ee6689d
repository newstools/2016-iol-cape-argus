Cape Town - When Rooney Tieties of Bellville South was born eight years ago, his parents were shocked and frightened when they learnt that he had a bilateral facial cleft, which affected the soft tissue and the underlying bone in his mouth. Unlike other children, who usually have a cleft on the lip, my son had a big opening from the mouth across his cheek towards the eyes. It was quite a scary thing to look at and I remember thinking to myself that he is not going to live long because of its severity, recalled his father, Jerome Ruiters.But today not only is Rooney a budding soccer and rugby player, but he is talkative and confident - thanks to the corrective surgery he had at Tygerberg Hospital in 2009 as part of the Smile Foundation s Smile Week.This week, little Rooney was back in that hospital with 42 other children who are to receive reconstructive surgeries as part of the eighth Smile Week, which has been sponsored by the Vodacom Foundation.The foundation is dedicated to arranging free corrective surgery for children with facial anomalies. One in 750 children has been born with a facial anomaly. This time, Rooney will have another corrective surgery to fix his eyebrows and other minor procedures to his face, including one on his nostrils which will further enhance his confidence and stand him in good stead to continue his remarkable recovery and personal achievements. Another surgery performed at Tygerberg Hospital on Tuesday was on eight-month-old Esinalo Mafani of Uitenhage who has scaphocephaly - a condition where the head becomes narrow due to the premature fusion of the sagittal suture, negatively affecting the growth of the brain.The eight-hour operation, which involved remodelling little Esinalo s skull in order for his brain to have space to develop normally, is expected to give him the chance of having a normal life. Marc Lubner, the founder of Smile Foundation, said the aim of the surgeries was aimed at making these kids, who were often excluded, part of society.Mthobeli Tengimfene, the Vodacom Foundation s executive head, said: Babies with cleft lips and palates find it hard to suckle and this impacts their growth and development. It also has an influence on their speech so the surgery ensures that the children can develop to their full potential. [email&#160;protected]Cape Argus
