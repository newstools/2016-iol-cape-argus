His neighbours believe his death was a result of a failed housebreaking, but police said Petersen s death may have been connected to a domestic violence dispute.Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut said a woman, 32, from Pelican Park was arrested on a charge of murder.. Petersen ran a non-profit organisation, the Kommetjie Environmental Awareness Group, with his business partner, Trish van Niekerk.The group was dedicated to the preservation and upliftment of the environment. He was such a kind-hearted person, said Van Niekerk. One who would open his doors and give away everything he had to the poor and destitute. We are making a movie on our project. He was so excited, me too, because we are doing it for the community. Cape Argus
