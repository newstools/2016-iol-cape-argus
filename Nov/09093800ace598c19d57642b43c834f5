Kindly note......please advice (sic) as many people as soon as possible. You will receive an SMS from a number similar to the one that you get bank notifications from , the SMS will indicate a problem in your account and the 'consultant' will contact you. When the 'consultant ' contacts you he or she will start confirming all your details and your account number and then they will ask you what kind of a phone you are using.

The fraudster will then be able to receive OTP's (one time pins) and or RVN' s (Random Verification Number) from your bank and have access to bank accounts. By the time you realise that your cell number is not working your MONEY wl be out f your account. Please announce it to your loved ones. Let's save the world from this criminals. Francois Groenewald: Specialist Investigator Tel. 021 940 9724 Fax 021 400 8671 Pls let everyone be informed. (sic)A source within the South African Police Service (SAPS) says the message is not an official warning. We (SAPS) are aware of this warnings and allegations posted on social media/whatsapps/Facebook etc but cannot substantiate the legitimacy thereof due to a lack of evidence. We urge people to refrain from posting these false rumours on social media, and ask people to please check their facts before they place anything on these social media platforms, the source said. The time that we as SAPS spend on responding to reports like this only to find out it is false or a hoax could have been better applied to crime prevention. However, the police have said it's always good to be vigilant .Cape Argus
