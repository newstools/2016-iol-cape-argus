Cape Town - The Deputy Minister of Basic Education in the Western Cape, Enver Surty, has entered the fray over proposed amendments to a provincial education act, which could make it possible for principals to give the go-ahead for alcohol to be sold to adults at school functions.In August, the Cape Argus reported Education MEC Debbie Sch&#xE4;fer was proposing sweeping changes to the Western Cape Provincial School Education Act of 1997, including a proposal to allow for the principal or governing body to approve the sale or use of alcohol on school premises, &#x201C;but strictly subject to the provisions of the Western Cape Liquor Act&#x201D; and other conditions the school wished to set.She said she had received complaints from schools who wished to hold fundraisers where alcohol would be sold or consumed, but this was against the law.At a press briefing in Pretoria on Tuesday, Surty said: &#x201C;As educators if we basically condone, allow or promote this particular reality, even if it is for fundraising, what kind of signal are we sending?&#x201D;He said he didn&#x2019;t know whether Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga had been consulted about the proposed amendments.&#x201C;You know the Western Cape, you know the issues of drugs, alcoholism, gangsterism are huge. And if it means us intervening, where appropriate, we will do so not because of any political contestation but because of the issue, because we are party to a programme where we&#x2019;re trying to reduce alcohol consumption.&#x201D;He said there was a two-year process of amending the Basic Education Laws Amendment Act, which involved officials from the Western Cape.&#x201C;The legal adviser of the Western Cape Education Department was part of that. We are quite surprised that after that process, and at the last Council of Education Ministers meeting we discussed the (national) bill, that we now read about a proposal coming from the Western Cape.&#x201D;In a statement released on Wednesday, ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs said the proposal was not only misguided, but dangerous.&#x201C;We have to emphasise to Sch&#xE4;fer that the point is to push alcohol access further and further away from our communal spaces. Bringing them into our classrooms is a huge betrayal to all the efforts national government and surprisingly provincial government has been putting in trying to lower the consumption of alcohol over the last few years.&#x201C;The National Liquor Act already states it clearly liquor premises should be located at least 500m away from schools, places of worship, recreation, rehabilitation or treatment centres, residential areas and public institutions.&#x201D;Sch&#xE4;fer said she was somewhat surprised by Surty&#x2019;s comments.&#x201C;As a lawyer he knows the Department of Basic Education cannot intervene in provincial matters unless they follow the formal process laid out in the constitution.&#x201D;She said Surty was also aware basic education was a concurrent competence provided for in the constitution, which specifically allowed for provinces to make legislation that was contrary to national legislation.&#x201C;The fact the Western Cape has therefore contributed to the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill has no relevance to our ability to pass our own legislation. We have our own priorities in the Western Cape government.&#x201D;She said she agreed alcohol abuse was a huge problem countrywide, but this was despite it being banned in schools.&#x201C;This clearly shows the cause of the problem lies elsewhere. We will certainly look at putting in better safeguards in the legislation to protect learners, as it has never been the intention to allow the consumption or advertising of alcohol in front of learners. It is for adult functions only. &#x201C; [email&#160;protected] Cape Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
