Cape Town - In the midst of ongoing student protests at CPUT&#x2019;s Bellville campus, a shock announcement by the university council has revealed vice-chancellor Prins Nevhutalu has been placed on special leave indefinitely.Nevhutalu&#x2019;s special leave was backdated to last Friday - the same day 12 of the university&#x2019;s students appeared in court for public violence and contravening a High Court order.The university council chairman, Mbulelo Bikwani, would not be drawn on whether the vice-chancellor&#x2019;s special leave was connected to the ongoing student demonstrations on the university&#x2019;s campuses.Previously, university management had tried to quell tensions through engagement with student leaders which ended in poo-flinging. The talks remain deadlocked.Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the year with administrative operations, tutorials and lectures moved to Wingfield Military Base.Bikwani told the Cape Argus only the full approval of the executive committee would allow him to speak to the media.In continued protests on CPUT&#x2019;s Bellville campus, five cars were set alight on Monday. CPUT&#x2019;s spokeswoman, Lauren Kansley, said there were allegations some disgruntled members of a private security company had joined in the protest action. This would be investigated.&#x201C;Police were on scene to contain the situation. Most staff and students were not on campus when the cars were torched,&#x201D; said Kansley. Some of the cars belonged to members of the university&#x2019;s private security company and the CPUT security team, she understood.Police spokeswoman Brigadier Sally de Beer said cases of public violence were being investigated.No arrests have been made.Police are also investigating the torching of four cars at UCT&#x2019;s lower campus in the early hours of Tuesday.The university confirmed the cars, parked in Chapel Road behind the Baxter residence, were set alight at about 2am.UCT has condemned the incident.
