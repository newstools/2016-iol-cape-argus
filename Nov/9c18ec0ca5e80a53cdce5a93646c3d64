Cape Town - A pit bull which attacked a number of smaller dogs on beaches and parks along the Atlantic Seaboard has been removed from its owner, Francoise Lempereur.It has reportedly been taken by an organisation which works with pit bulls and other fighter breeds and will undergo rehabilitation.Lempereur, an advocate in Cape Town, has been accused of allowing her unleashed dog to attack up to 15 dogs over the past year without showing remorse or taking action to avert further incidents.Ward councillor Dave Bryant confirmed the dog had been removed from Lempereur.Bryant said if found guilty, Lempereur could face a fine.Lempereur did not respond to a message on Tuesday, but earlier told the Cape Argus she was very sorry about the attacks and should have had her dog on a lead. She also said she would muzzle him in future if she took him out.Lempereur said she had been intimidated and her dog injured by having things put up his bum and in his eyes .But owners of dogs who have been on the receiving end of attacks claim Lempereur seemed unperturbed following the incidents.Rowan Katzew, whose dog Django, a Jack Russell cross, was attacked twice within two weeks by the pit bull said when he shouted at Lempereur to stop, she turned and screamed back f*** you with a smile on her face and walked away.Shaun Hoddy, whose French bulldog puppy Pablo and Boston Terrier Peggy were both attacked on the Sea Point Promenade earlier this month, also said Lempereur had refused to stop afterwards. Two concerned residents went after her and asked her to stop but she refused. He said Lempereur had since threatened to charge him with crimen injuria.But Hoddy denied intimidating her. I did call her a f**king bitch and said I would put it on Facebook but I never threatened her in any other way. [email&#160;protected]Cape Argus
