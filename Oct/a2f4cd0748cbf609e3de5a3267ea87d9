Cape Town - A prominent academic has likened UCT protesters to Nigerian terror group Boko Haram militants after they allegedly punched the university&#x2019;s vice-chancellor Max Price.Professor Achille Mbembe, who has worked at University of the Witwatersrand in Joburg and other institutions worldwide, on Sunday angered protesters after he penned and published online a response to the alleged altercation between students and Price on Friday afternoon at UCT.Mbembe defended Price as the vice-chancellor of &#x201C;one of the most important institutions of higher learning in our continent&#x201D;.&#x201C;He has been at the receiving end of some of the most vicious and despicable attacks vice-chancellors in South African universities are nowadays routinely subjected to,&#x201D; said Mbembe.&#x201C;He has been demonised by student militants and vilified by right-wing white constituencies which are nostalgic of the days of segregation.&#x201C;As I write, it is difficult to say when this will stop and who will stop what looks more and more like a Boko Haram style of violence - intimidation, filibustering, name calling, emotional blackmail and, increasingly, physical assault, the destruction of precious public assets and the use of fire as a sacrificial and pseudo-purificatory weapon.&#x201D;UCT arts student Dean Hutton, who has worked as a photojournalist for a number of years, responded to Mbembe.&#x201C;I am not Boko Haram and neither are any of the people I have associated with and this is a very, very damaging thing to evoke,&#x201D; she said.Mbembe replied: &#x201C;I have no reason to not believe you. Boko Haram style or not, I simply do not see how physically assaulting Dr Price will bring about free education. If we cannot draw the line here, then we condone the unjustifiable.&#x201D;He said Boko Haram aimed &#x201C;to decolonise so-called western knowledge and science&#x201D;.&#x201C;We know where it ended up - atrocities, hostage taking, scorched earth tactics.&#x201D;Hutton asked Mbembe whether he had an &#x201C;idea the kind of abuse of power any of us face when it comes to private security and police&#x201D;.She said Mbembe&#x2019;s comments are the kind that &#x201C;gives the state the excuse to continue throwing stun grenades, and shooting rubber bullets, then water cannons, and then live ammunition&#x201D;.Another response, from writer Gillian Schutte who has tackled racism and education previously, indicated frustration with Mbembe&#x2019;s stance.&#x201C;Funny how Achille Mbembe has f*kall (f*ck all) to say on the trauma the students have had to deal with from the violence aimed at them by the securocrat neoliberal system,&#x201D; said Schutte.&#x201C;How much longer is he going to demonise this student movement with poetic hysteria?&#x201D;Cape Town filmmaker Nadine Cloete, who made the film Action Kommandant about slain anti-apartheid activist Ashley Kriel, said she was at the meeting between Price and students on Friday.&#x201C;I was there when he was coming to make an appearance.When he left he was the one who pushed people out of the way,&#x201D; said Cloete.&#x201C;There was a confrontation between him and students. But I didn&#x2019;t see anyone touch him. All of a sudden there were stun grenades. Police were also there with cameras filming students.&#x201D; [email&#160;protected] Cape Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
