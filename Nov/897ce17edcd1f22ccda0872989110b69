He is yet to be found,&#x201D; said Traut.The woman was left behind unharmed.&#x201C;We are all in the dark and searching for him,&#x201D; Cader said. &#x201C;We have heard no news and no calls for ransom. We are asking anyone who might have any information to please come forward.&#x201D;He said police were looking at the CCTV footage obtained from surrounding businesses and questioning eyewitnesses.Cader said Deshmukh&#x2019;s wife, Nafeesah, 40, and his three children, aged between 10 and 14, were &#x201C;worried sick&#x201D;.&#x201C;The family is absolutely broken apart. His three kids and his wife are taking it very hard. It is so sad because the children are suffering the most.&#x201C;His family is overseas and they can&#x2019;t understand why he is not found. It has been (more than) 24 hours and nothing has happened. The police have the registration number of the vehicle but nothing has turned up.&#x201D;This wasn&#x2019;t the first time Deshmukh had been targeted, other business owners said.The son of the owner of Mukhtar Hiring, Anwar Karbray, said Deshmukh had almost been abducted in January by four men in a white bakkie. &#x201C;They tried to take his Mercedes-Benz, but could not start the car.&#x201C;Another business, MA Powertrade Cash and Carry on the same block, was targeted during a separate incident at night.&#x201C;Usually when we have robberies in this area, the criminals take the cash. This is organised kidnapping. They had big guns and handcuffs when they took Naushad,&#x201D; said Karbray.A business manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Athlone business district had become a target for organised crime in recent years.&#x201C;When I left here on Monday night, it was deadly quiet and I felt ill at ease. I checked to see if the security was still on the block and I spotted Naushad locking up his place. I decided to go home at peace that at least we were safe.&#x201C;I got a call 10 minutes afterwards informing me what had happened,&#x201D; he said.The business manager, who has given police a statement, said he had heard the kidnappers had been drawing money from Deshmukh&#x2019;s credit cards.It is believed the vehicle used to kidnap Deshmukh was discovered dumped in Nyanga, but the police could not confirm this.Athlone business owners raised the alarm about an armed gang - part of an alleged syndicate - targeting their premises two years ago.Elite Wholesalers was held up by a gang, the third such attack in Athlone in 2014. A shop owner was rushed to hospital after a separate robbery in Athlone two years ago.Police have asked anyone with information on the kidnapping or Deshmukh&#x2019;s whereabouts to contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
