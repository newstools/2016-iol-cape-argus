Cape Town - Local celebrities and Capetonians have pledged their support for the Don t Look Away campaign, Independent Media s official 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children initiative.Don t Look Away is in support of the worldwide campaign to highlight gender-based violence from Friday, International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, to December 10, International Human Rights Day.Singer Chad Saaiman said he fully endorsed the campaign. We need to spread the word against violence. People need to support the 16 Days of Activism campaign. Speak against it, be open. People need to know there is support for them; they are not alone. Radio personality Liezel van der Westhuizen and Ryan O Connor also pledged their support. Today I visited a school in Sir Lowry s Park where children as young as grade one told their stories of when they were assaulted. A lot still needs to be done in the fight against women and children abuse, said Van der Westhuizen. O Connor said: It is good media houses focus on the 16 Days of Activism campaign and issues such as violence against women and children. The social change initiative calls on people to paint their index finger with orange nail polish or wear something orange to show support. Orange is the colour identified by the United Nations to symbolise a brighter future without violence. Building up to the launch on Thursday, Independent Media spoke to Capetonians in St George s Mall.Yusuf Hoosain said: Unfortunately there is a minority group that does not regard women with the respect they deserve. Audrey Daniels said as a mother she experienced women and children abuse in Kalksteenfontein. Also our women are keeping quiet about abuse, we need to educate our women so this thing of keeping quiet must stop today. [email&#160;protected]Cape Argus
