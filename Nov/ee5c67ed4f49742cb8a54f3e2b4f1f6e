Cape Town - Heroin accounts for over a third of drug-related deaths in South Africa, according to a new study that reviewed drug-related deaths in the country.New research by the University of Pretoria, which investigated illegal drug useof people after autopsies were performed at the Pretoria Medico-legal Laboratory over a 10-year period (2003-2012), found heroin was the most common drug detected.Heroin was detected in 35.2 percent of people followed by cocaine in about 20 percent.Amphetamines and methaqualone were relatively rarely detected, being found in 6.4 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively, of the 385 cases that were analysed.Cannabis was detected in 4.6 percent of the cases.Males accounted for the majority of positive cases at 90.3 percent.The most common age category for the deceased who tested positive for illicit drugs was 20 - 30 years - suggesting drug users had a short life expectancy, which researchers put it at 32.9 - 42.9 years lower than that of the general population of South Africa.The race or ethnic profile of the deceased who tested positive for drugs was mostly white - accounting for 85.1 percent of positive cases, despite only making up 20.1 percent of the general Tshwane population.While black Africans were the majority, accounting for 75.4 percent of the population - 11 percent of positive cases were black. The study also showed in 75 of 385 cases, there were signs of decomposition at autopsy, suggesting there had been substantial delays in finding the body or retrieving it from the scene of death.In 109 of the 385 cases (or in 28.3 percent of the cases), the pathologist concluded the cause of death was drug related. In 96 of the cases, a history of previous drug use was noted, and in 81 cases drug paraphernalia were present at the scene of death.Writing in the SA Medical Journal, lead researcher Lorraine du Toit-Prinsloo said the latest findings were consistent with findings from other studies.She said the low proportion of cases of cannabis use was however unexpected, as cannabis has been documented to be the most frequently used drug in Gauteng. She, however, said cannabis contributed little to mortality. The most common combination detected was that of heroin and cocaine, a combination referred to as &#x201C;speedballing&#x201D; among drug users.&#x201C;Besides the individual lethal effects of the various drugs of abuse, drug use in younger persons is a major risk factor for fatal accidents or injuries, whereas in older drug abusers use of drugs may precipitate death due to underlying cardiovascular disease,&#x201D; Du Toit-Prinsloo said.
