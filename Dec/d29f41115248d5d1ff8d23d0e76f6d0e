Cape Town - After coming under fire on Twitter on Sunday, the latest Facebook racist, Vanessa Hartley, could find herself in more trouble on Monday as the Hout Bay Civic Association will be lodging a complaint at Hout Bay police station.Its secretary, Roscoe Jacobs, was due to lay the complaint at 11am. We strongly condemn the racist comments made by #VanessaHartley on Facebook, the association posted on its social media platforms. Hout Bay belongs to all who live in it! On Sunday, a screengrab of a post by Hartley went viral. They like stupid animals, she wrote. We should tie them to a rope. To many Africans flocking to Hout Bay. Draw up a petition. Soon there will be nothing left of Hout Bay. It wasn t long before #VanessaHartley was trending. On Sunday, the ANC said it would be lodging a complaint with the SA Human Rights Commission. We reject Vanessa Hartley s racist rants as both a distorted view of what this country is about and certainly not representing the majority of our people in this province. Racists will not have the final word, the party said. We request that the SA Human Rights Commission apply maximum punitive and corrective measures within their domain to ensure this kind of behaviour is rejected and abandoned. Cape Argus
