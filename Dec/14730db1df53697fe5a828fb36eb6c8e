According to Dr Cleeve Robertson, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) chief executive, an estimated 2 000 drownings, of which 600 are of children, are reported in South Africa annually.In the Western Cape there had been 12 drownings at beaches from December 1 last year, to January 6. Executive director for safety and security Richard Bosman said 94 near-drownings had been recorded and there had been 138 incidents in which swimmers in trouble had been rescued.On Monday two males, an 18-year-old and a 30-year-old, were swept out to sea in separate incidents at Monwabisi and Mnandi beaches. Searches for them continue.NSRI Strandfontein unit deputy commander Clint Abrahams said a team had been called to Mnandi beach where four Gugulethu teens had been swept out by rip currents. Three were rescued. One of the three teenagers rescued by lifeguards, a 15-year-old, was treated by Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services paramedics for hypothermia and for non-fatal symptoms and taken to hospital. Two hours later, at about 6.15pm, Abrahams said a call had come in about a missing swimmer at Monwabisi. An extensive sea, shore, and air search revealed no sign of the 30-year-old man, missing in the water after being swept out to sea by rip-currents.Other than that he had been wearing shorts, Abrahams said no more details about him could be obtained.Mayoral committee member for community services Anda Ntsodo recently cautioned beachgoers about festive season swimming. On peak days, the number of people visiting our beaches and pools makes it very difficult for lifeguards to keep a watchful eye on all swimmers all of the time. The lifeguards are under constant pressure to keep a keen eye out for anyone in distress. Parents need to be on high alert when their children are playing in or near the ocean, a river or a pool, and are urged to be vigilant. He said more than 100 lifeguards had been deployed to beaches and were on duty daily from 10am to 6pm.Cape Argus
