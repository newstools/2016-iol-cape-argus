The continent is not so much a melting pot as it is a fusion of all of us. We have been telling our own stories for a while now and it&apos;s our duty as the media to let people speak for themselves through the use of technology and solid journalism.&#x201C;The trajectory of mobile technologies also demands that we respond accordingly and aggressively in this space.
