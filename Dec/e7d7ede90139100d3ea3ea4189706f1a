The director of Ribbons4Roses, a charity group for children with cancer, autism, Down syndrome and disabilities, Denzile Reddiar, was one of the people that shared the video on Facebook who said that it was the most demeaning and demoralising incident of bullying in schools . People must be held accountable for their behaviour. As part of our zero tolerance to bullying, the Ribbons4Roses team have been instructed to hold any persons involved accountable.

Action needs to be taken against the girl dishing it out and the one filming it, she said.Cornel Chambers, who showed disgust towards the video, said: The girl that is bullying is the one with the problem, not the other one. You have no respect for other people. This is why our world is the way it is, because of people who behave like you. Cape Argus
