The Right2Know, the Delegate Children and Youth Movement, the Whole World Women Association, the Lorna Mlofana Parents Movement, the Progressive Youth Movement and the Ilitha Youth Movement were among the organisations who marched in solidarity on Tuesday. The day has been a success and I am very happy to have seen the support from other movements, said Noncedo Bulana of the Lorna Mlofana Movement. This march is not only for the period of 16 Days of Activism, we also wanted to show our struggle against unhygienic living conditions in Khayelitsha while we have women representing us in Parliament such as Bathabile Dlamini. Children also supported the march to raise the issues they deal with at home. The highlight was hearing young children who face violence speak out about their problems today, Bulana said.Pupu Fumba of the Right2Know Campaign said: We are fortunate to be in partnership with the Lorna Mlofana Parents Movement. Supporting this march was a good cause, and it was exciting to hear children having the courage to raise their personal problems in front of us. We were also able to identify their problems, which saw easy interaction with them. The residents later took their march to Taiwan, an informal settlement in Khayelitsha, where they gathered to raise concerns about sanitation in the area. They are to speak about the matter to Khayelitsha s ward 18 councillor, Ntomboxolo Kopman. Bulana said they would soon launch a health forum with the other movements, as part of their plans for service delivery and sanitation.Cape Argus
