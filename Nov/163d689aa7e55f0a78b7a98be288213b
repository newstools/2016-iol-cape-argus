Cape Town - The City of Cape Town is cleaning up its statute books and plans to repeal more than 300 outdated by-laws inherited from former municipalities.Many of them date back to the 1950s.Among the laws to be repealed is a 1977 taxi by-law of the Durbanville Municipality, which requires taxi drivers wear a clean, white coat approved by the municipality&#x2019;s chief traffic officer before being allowed to operate the vehicle.Mayor Patricia de Lille said on Wednesday even though the municipalities no longer existed, the by-laws were technically still in effect.The mayoral committee has agreed to recommend to the council the by-laws be repealed when they next meet.A report to mayco noted that if not repealed, the old by-laws could conflict with by-laws promulgated by the City of Cape Town.The antiquated by-laws became part of city law when the unicity was formed in 2000.The 306 by-laws were adopted by the city&#x2019;s 30 former smaller municipal councils, including Goodwood, Kraaifontein and Simon&#x2019;s Town.From the Bellville, Gordon&#x2019;s Bay, Kuils River, Strand and Fish Hoek municipalities, the city inherited a host of regulations on camping and caravan parks dating back to the 1960s.Also still in effect are by-laws from various municipalities on aerials for television reception, enacted in 1975.The former City of Cape Town&#x2019;s traffic by-laws from the 1970s are also still on the books and more than 40 years of municipal policies on leave regulations for staff, from 1950 to 1996.Somerset West&#x2019;s by-laws on keeping dogs in the 1980s are also still in effect, as well as the laws on parking meters.&#x201C;As we intensify our efforts to become a well-run government, the repeal of these by-laws will assist us to work more efficiently by cutting down on unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape,&#x201D; said De Lille.
