Cape Town - Age has proved to be nothing but a number for 12-year-old Daniella Zinanni, a pupil at Elkanah House Primary, who hopes her mission to help the less advantaged will inspire others.With help from her mother Sheila, principal Arthur Preston and classmates, Daniella earlier this year started the Bhabhathane Butterfly Foundation (BBF), an initiative which aims to provide sanitary products to disadvantaged girls. Doing this has been really fun. The whole idea followed after returning from a school outing when I was in Grade 4, and we learnt about the lack of sanitary pads for some girls in the Atlantis area, she said.As part of her work for the BBF project, she collects donations of sanitary products and raises money to buy the products, which she distributes to local schools. It has been an amazing, wonderful year for her, and a lot of pupils have benefited from this, her mom said. I would say that having to do the initiative has really been beneficial for some children as it helped raise awareness about the real problem surrounding the lack of sanitary towels. Daniella also hosted a fun run where donations of sanitary towels were the currency for entry. The event was successful according to Sheila, who said 400 participants came in support of the day. They received more than 1 000 donations. There were so many sponsors who offered to help and all the supporters were really amazing, she said.Cape Argus
